===

## The promise is real {.center}

AI writes code. Fast. Confident.

*You've seen the demos. For simple things, it genuinely works.*

===

## For the first version — impressive {.center}

Everything fits in one context window.
The AI sees the whole picture. The code is coherent.

*No wonder people are saying "we don't need developers anymore."*

===

## Then the system grows {.center .warn}

New features. More code. Decisions made months ago.

The AI can no longer hold it all at once.

**Three problems start quietly compounding.**

---

## Problem 1 — Average {.center}

AI *knows* BDD, DDD, clean architecture.

But when you just ask it to solve a problem,
it falls back to the patterns most common in its training data.

*Competent code. Rarely principled code.*

===

## Problem 2 — Pleaser {.center}

It agrees with you.

Applauds your thinking.
The longer the conversation, the less it pushes back.

*You asked for a thinking partner.
You got an enthusiastic yes-person.*

===

## Problem 3 {.center .warn}

## Day one. Every. Single. Session.

The AI starts fresh.
Every. Single. Time.

No memory. No context. No understanding.

*That's not a bug. It's fundamental.*

---

## You know this feeling {.center}

Landing in a new project.

Not productive from day one.
Reading the code isn't enough.

Docs too verbose about things that don't matter.
Out of date on the things that do.

*You guess. You ask questions that feel obvious.
You slowly piece it together.*

===

## For an AI — that's every conversation {.center .warn-title}

## For an AI, it's *day one* in your project. Every session.

If you manually re-introduce your codebase every time —
explaining context, repeating decisions, re-establishing conventions —

**you've already lost the productivity benefit.**

===

## The documentation you've always dreamed of {.center}

**Not too much. Just enough.**

Current. Purposeful. Direct.
Not repeating what the code already says.
Not so elaborate it becomes a burden to maintain.

*An experienced developer who reads fast — up to speed in minutes.
Not days.*

**Now you have to build it. To stay productive.
Bob helps you do exactly that.**

---

## Bob is the structure {.center .thesis}

Discipline. Documentation. Explicit commands.

**AI that reads context. Builds on context. Keeps context alive.**

*Not vibe coding. Engineering.*

../img/bob-team.jpg | One partner. Every phase. | wide
:::

## Bob wears many hats {.center}

:::cards
/bob:product-coach | Product strategist
/bob:brainstorm | Thinking partner
/bob:plan | Implementation planner
/bob:review-plan | Critical reviewer
/bob:implement | Disciplined executor
/bob:review | Code reviewer
/bob:investigate | Bug investigator
/bob:document | Documentation writer
:::

===

## Three things that make it work {.center}

:::pillars
🎯 | Humans Decide | AI explores options. You pick direction. Nothing ships without your sign-off.
📄 | Files Remember | Close the laptop. Context survives in git — not in chat history.
📐 | Explicit Phases | You invoke a phase. The AI knows exactly what to do.
:::

---

## The pipeline {.center}

Each phase produces something a human reviews.
Each phase reads what the last one wrote.

:::pipeline
💡 | Brainstorm | Pick direction
📐 | Plan | Approve approach
🔍 | Review Plan | Verify assumptions
⚙️ | Implement | Sign off steps
📝 | Review | Own the result
:::

===

## Honest review is built in {.center}

:::compare
bad | The Pleaser Problem | Tells you your idea is great | Longer session = less pushback | You end up agreeing with yourself
good | How Bob fixes it | Fresh session reviews the plan | No memory of what produced it | Genuine critique. By design.
:::

---

## One feature. Five sessions. Clean code. {.center}

Each session independent.
Each one building on the last — through files.

A human made every significant decision.

===

## The week {.left}

:::journey
Mon | `/bob:brainstorm` | DDD principles loaded. Hard questions asked. You push back. It pushes back harder. Direction committed to a file.
Tue | `/bob:plan` | Fresh session. Reads Monday's file. Tests planned before code is written. You approve.
Wed | `/bob:review-plan` | Another fresh session stress-tests the plan. Finds the schema mismatch before it becomes code.
:::

===

## The week {.left}

:::journey
Thu | `/bob:implement` | Builds step by step. Tests after every change. Stops when it needs a human call. Reports everything.
Fri | `/bob:review` | Checks code against guidelines. Intent vs reality. Handoff doc anyone can own.
:::

===

## Every command is a conversation {.center}

Not one-shot automation.

The AI challenges you. Interviews you.
Asks the question you forgot to ask yourself.

**Acts as your partner, reviewer, coach, and critic.**

*You make the decisions. It does the groundwork.*

---

## The tenth feature {.center}

gets the same disciplined treatment as the first.

*That's what sustainable quality looks like.*

**Not impressive for a sprint. Sustainable over months.**

===

## Where to start {.center}

**New product?** → `/bob:product-vision`
**New feature?** → `/bob:brainstorm`
**Inherited codebase?** → `/bob:document`
**Not sure?** → *"Hi Bob, where do I start?"*

*No wrong place to start. Commands read what's available.*
