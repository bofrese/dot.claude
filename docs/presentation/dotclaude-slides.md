## The promise is real {.center}

AI writes code now. Fast. Confident.

*You've seen the demos. For simple things, it genuinely works.*

===

## For the first version… it's impressive {.center}

Everything fits in one context window.
The AI sees the whole picture — the code is coherent, it moves fast.

*No wonder people are saying: "We don't need developers anymore."*

---

## Then the system grows {.center .warn}

New features. More code. More decisions made months ago.
The codebase is no longer something one person — or one AI — can hold in their head.

**The AI can no longer see it all at once.**

===

## The discovery problem {.center}

Code dependencies? Sure, it finds those.

But it misses:
- That utility someone wrote last month
- How this component is *supposed* to be used
- The pattern everyone follows

**It reinvents the wheel. Every time.**

===

## The amnesia problem {.center}

Code describes **WHAT** the system does.

Rarely **WHY**.

*All those discussions, trade-offs, decisions?*
*Gone.*

===

## A developer who's been here for months just knows {.center}

How the pieces connect. What the conventions are.
Why something was built that way last quarter.

They build that knowledge **over time**.

===

## Day one. Every. Single. Time. {.center .warn}

The AI starts fresh. Every single session.

No memory. No context. No understanding.

*That's not a bug. It's a fundamental limit.*


===

## It gets worse {.center}

The code works — on day one. But it's not the kind that holds up as the system grows.

It tells you your plan is great. Even when it isn't.

**These problems don't just exist — they compound.**

===

## Would you board a plane… {.center .question}

…designed and built entirely by AI,
with no engineer reviewing it?

**Your software isn't different.**

===

## AI is a thinking tool {.center}

It should **amplify** your thinking. Not replace it.

*Structure is what makes that possible.*

---


## The documentation gap {.center}

For humans: Documentation helps you get up to speed.

For AI: **Documentation IS the context.**

*It needs structured knowledge. Discoverable. Systematic.*

But vibe coding AIs don't read docs.
They don't write docs.
They don't maintain docs.

**Unless you tell them to.**

===

## bob is that structure {.center .thesis}

The discipline. The documentation. The commands.

**AI that reads context. Updates context. Builds on context.**

*Not vibe coding. Engineering.*

## Three things that make it work {.center}

:::pillars
🎯 | Humans Decide | AI explores options. You pick the direction. Nothing ships without your sign-off.
📄 | Files Remember | Close the laptop. Context survives — in files, not chat history.
📐 | Explicit Phases | You invoke a phase. The AI knows exactly what to do.
:::

===

## The pipeline {.center}

Each phase produces something a human reviews.
Each phase reads what the last one wrote.

:::pipeline
💡 | Explore | Pick direction
📐 | Plan | Approve approach
🔍 | Review | Verify assumptions
⚙️ | Build | Sign off
📝 | Review | Own the result
:::

===

## Honest review is built in {.center}

:::compare
bad | The Pleaser Problem | AI tells you your idea is great | The longer the session, the less it pushes back | You end up agreeing with yourself
good | How bob fixes it | Hand the document to a fresh session | Frame it as someone else's work | Session boundaries kill the agreeing
:::

---

## One feature. Five days. {.center}

Here's what it looks like in practice.

===

## The week {.left}

:::journey
Mon | `/bob:brainstorm` | Explore the idea. The AI reads your product vision first. You decide the direction. Everything written down.
Tue | `/bob:plan` | Fresh session. Reads Monday's file. Turns the idea into a reviewable plan. You approve.
Wed | `/bob:review-plan` | Another fresh session stress-tests the plan. Catches bad assumptions before they become code.
:::

===

## The week {.left}

:::journey
Thu | `/bob:implement` | Builds step by step. Tests after each change. Stops if it needs a human call.
Fri | `/bob:review` | Reviews what was built. Compares intent vs reality. Handoff document anyone can own.
:::

===

## Every command starts a conversation

This is not one-off commands that fully automate the step.

It thinks critically, challenges you, interviews you.

Acts as you partner, guide, coach, mentor, and assistant.


---

## This is what sustainable AI looks like {.center}

Not *"AI does the work."*

**"AI helps you do better work. And you understand every line."**

*Quality that holds up. Not just the first week.*

===

## Where to start {.center}

**New product?** → `/bob:product-vision`
**New feature?** → `/bob:brainstorm`
**Have a plan?** → `/bob:implement`
**No docs yet?** → `/bob:document`

*No wrong place to start. Commands read what's available.*
