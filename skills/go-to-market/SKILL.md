# Go-to-Market Principles

Compact reference for distribution, customer acquisition, and growth strategy. Apply when working on GTM strategy, channel selection, or growth planning.

---

## Core Truth

**Distribution equals product.** Mediocre product + great distribution > great product + weak distribution. Plan distribution before building.

---

## The GTM Question

"If we build this, how will people find out?"

No clear answer = no GTM strategy, just hope.

---

## Channel Categories

**Owned** (website, email, blog, social)
- Pros: Direct relationship, no platform risk
- Cons: Hard to build from zero

**Earned** (organic search, PR, referrals, community)
- Pros: High trust, low CAC
- Cons: Slow, hard to control

**Paid** (ads, sponsorships, affiliates)
- Pros: Fast, scalable, predictable
- Cons: Expensive, stops when budget stops

**Winning formula: 1 paid + 1 earned → owned**

## Channel Selection

### Where Does Your Customer Hang Out?

Map customer journey: where they learn, evaluate, decide.

| Customer | Effective Channels |
|----------|-------------------|
| Developers | GitHub, HN, dev communities, technical docs |
| B2B buyers | LinkedIn, events, case studies, sales |
| Consumers | Instagram, TikTok, influencers, viral loops |
| SMB owners | Google/FB ads, business groups, referrals |
| Enterprise | Sales, conferences, analyst relations |

### Start with ONE Channel

Pick where you have unfair advantage:
- Existing audience
- Channel expertise
- Budget advantage
- Network/relationships

Commit 3 months. Make it work or kill it. Then add second.

---

## Bullseye Framework

**Outer Ring (Brainstorm):** List 15-20 plausible channels

**Middle Ring (Test):** Pick 3-5, run cheap tests ($500-2k each), measure CAC

**Inner Ring (Focus):** Double down on best CAC channel, optimize until plateau, then add next

Don't spread thin. One channel done well.

## Common Channels

| Channel | Best For | Time | Cost | Key Metric |
|---------|----------|------|------|------------|
| **Content** | B2B, dev tools, long sales | 6-12mo | Low cash, high time | Organic → trial |
| **Paid Search** | High-intent, existing demand | Immediate | $1-50/click | CPC × conv = CAC |
| **Paid Social** | Awareness, visual products | Immediate | $0.50-10/click | CPM, CTR, conv |
| **Sales** | High ACV ($10k+), enterprise | 3-6mo cycle | Sales salaries | Meetings, close rate |
| **Community** | Dev tools, niche audiences | 12+ mo | Low cash, high time | Size, engagement |
| **Partnerships** | Workflow enhancers | 3-6mo | Rev share or dev | Referred users |
| **Referrals** | Network effects products | Immediate | Incentive cost | Viral coefficient |
| **Influencer** | Consumer, visual products | 1-3mo | Commission or fee | Conv per influencer |

## CAC Economics

**CAC = Total acquisition spend ÷ customers acquired**

Include: ad spend, content costs, sales salaries, tools, agencies

**Channel viability: CAC < ⅓ LTV**

---

## Growth Loops

**Viral:** User signs up → invites → they sign up → cycle (K > 1 = exponential)

**Content:** Create content → ranks → signups → users create content → cycle

**Performance:** Ad spend → customers → revenue → more ad spend → cycle

**Sales:** Success → case studies → credibility → easier sales → cycle

Best loops are self-reinforcing. Growth creates more growth.

---

## Launch Strategy

**Soft (Beta):** Limited audience, 1-3mo, learn before wide release. Risk: momentum fizzles.

**Public:** Announce widely (PH, HN, press), 1-day event. One shot, must be ready.

**Rolling:** Launch to segments sequentially, 3-6mo. Controlled, learn/adapt.

---

## Distribution Moats

**Network Effects:** Product improves with users. Reduces CAC over time.

**Brand:** Strong brand = direct search. Stripe, Notion, Figma.

**Organic:** Own key search terms. Free acquisition at scale.

**Platform:** Embedded in platforms customers use. Piggyback distribution.

Build for defensibility, not just initial traction.

---

## Red Flags

**"We'll get press and go viral"** → Viral isn't strategy, it's luck.

**"We'll do everything: ads, content, events..."** → Spreading thin. Win one channel.

**"Product is so good, people will find us"** → No. Distribution isn't automatic.

**"GTM after we build"** → Backwards. Distribution harder than product.

**"Word-of-mouth is our channel"** → WOM results from PMF + GTM, not the strategy itself.

---

## GTM Checklist

- [ ] Identified where target customer hangs out?
- [ ] Picked 1-2 focus channels?
- [ ] Have realistic CAC target from LTV?
- [ ] Tested channels cheaply first?
- [ ] Have content/messaging ready?
- [ ] Can measure CAC accurately?
- [ ] Identified growth loop?
- [ ] Have unfair distribution advantage?

---

## Key Insight

**Most products fail from lack of distribution, not bad product.**

Build distribution into strategy from day one. Undiscovered product = non-existent product.
