# Go-to-Market Principles

Compact reference for distribution, customer acquisition, and growth strategy. Load when working on GTM strategy, channel selection, or growth planning.

## Core Truth

**Distribution is as important as product.** A mediocre product with great distribution beats a great product with weak distribution. Plan how customers will discover you BEFORE building, not after.

---

## The GTM Question

"If we build this, how will people find out?"

If you can't answer this clearly and specifically, you don't have a GTM strategy. You have hope.

---

## Channel Thinking

### The Three Channel Categories

**1. Owned Channels**
- You control them, no intermediaries
- **Examples:** Website, email list, blog, social accounts
- **Pros:** Direct relationship, no platform risk
- **Cons:** Hard to build from zero

**2. Earned Channels**
- You earn attention through content, PR, word-of-mouth
- **Examples:** Organic search, media coverage, referrals, community
- **Pros:** High trust, low cost per acquisition
- **Cons:** Slow to build, hard to control

**3. Paid Channels**
- You pay for reach and attention
- **Examples:** Ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn), sponsorships, affiliates
- **Pros:** Fast, scalable, predictable
- **Cons:** Expensive, stops when you stop paying

**Most successful GTM = 1 paid + 1 earned, feeding into owned.**

## Channel Selection Framework

### Step 1: Where Does Your Customer Hang Out?

**Not:** "Everyone uses Google"
**Instead:** "SaaS founders read Hacker News, indie hackers browse Twitter, CTOs attend conferences"

**Map customer journey:**
- Where do they learn about new tools? (podcasts, blogs, communities)
- Where do they evaluate solutions? (review sites, peer recommendations)
- Where do they make purchase decisions? (free trial, sales call, self-serve signup)

### Step 2: Match Channel to Customer Behavior

| Customer Type | Likely Effective Channels |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Developers | GitHub, Hacker News, dev communities, technical blogs, docs |
| B2B decision makers | LinkedIn, industry events, case studies, sales outreach |
| Consumers | Instagram, TikTok, influencer partnerships, viral loops |
| SMB owners | Google Ads, Facebook, local business groups, referrals |
| Enterprises | Sales team, conferences, analyst relations, partnerships |

### Step 3: Start with ONE Channel

**The mistake:** Trying 10 channels at once

**The strategy:** Pick one channel where you have an unfair advantage:
- Audience you already have
- Expertise in that channel
- Budget advantage
- Network/relationships

**Commit to one channel for 3 months.** Make it work or deliberately kill it. Then add a second.

---

## The Bullseye Framework (Traction)

Test channels in concentric circles:

### Outer Ring (Brainstorm)
- List all plausible channels (15-20)
- No filtering yet, just ideas

### Middle Ring (Test)
- Pick 3-5 most promising
- Run cheap tests ($500-$2000 each)
- Measure cost per acquisition

### Inner Ring (Focus)
- Double down on the one channel with best CAC
- Optimize it until it plateaus
- Then add next channel

**Don't spread thin. One channel at a time, done well.**

## Common Acquisition Channels

### Content Marketing
- **How it works:** Create valuable content, rank in search, convert readers
- **Best for:** B2B, dev tools, education, long sales cycles
- **Time to results:** 6-12 months
- **Cost:** Low cash, high time
- **Key metric:** Organic traffic → trial signups

### Paid Search (Google Ads)
- **How it works:** Bid on keywords, show ads to searchers
- **Best for:** High-intent searches, known problem, existing demand
- **Time to results:** Immediate
- **Cost:** $1-$50+ per click depending on competition
- **Key metric:** CPC × conversion rate = CAC

### Paid Social (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- **How it works:** Target demographics/interests, show ads
- **Best for:** Broad awareness, visual products, impulse buys
- **Time to results:** Immediate
- **Cost:** $0.50-$10 per click typically
- **Key metric:** CPM, CTR, conversion rate

### Sales Outreach
- **How it works:** Identify prospects, cold email/call, demo, close
- **Best for:** High ACV ($10k+), complex products, enterprise
- **Time to results:** 3-6 months (sales cycle)
- **Cost:** Sales team salaries
- **Key metric:** Meetings booked, close rate, deal size

### Community Building
- **How it works:** Build community around problem/topic, offer product as solution
- **Best for:** Developer tools, niche audiences, high engagement
- **Time to results:** 12+ months
- **Cost:** Low cash, very high time
- **Key metric:** Community size, engagement, conversion

### Partnerships & Integrations
- **How it works:** Partner with platforms/products customers already use
- **Best for:** Products that enhance existing workflows
- **Time to results:** 3-6 months (partnership negotiation)
- **Cost:** Rev share or integration dev cost
- **Key metric:** Referred users, conversion rate

### Referrals & Word-of-Mouth
- **How it works:** Customers tell others, you incentivize or make it easy
- **Best for:** Products with network effects, natural shareability
- **Time to results:** Immediate (once you have users)
- **Cost:** Referral incentives, product features
- **Key metric:** Viral coefficient, referral rate

### Influencer/Affiliate Marketing
- **How it works:** Pay influencers or affiliates to promote
- **Best for:** Consumer products, visual products, clear value prop
- **Time to results:** 1-3 months (finding right influencers)
- **Cost:** Commission or flat fee
- **Key metric:** Conversions per influencer, CAC

---

## The CAC Equation

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = Total acquisition spend ÷ customers acquired**

### What to Include in CAC
- Ad spend
- Content creation costs
- Sales salaries and commissions
- Marketing tools and software
- Agency/contractor fees

### Channel Comparison

Test channels by CAC, then optimize the winners:

| Channel | Test Budget | Customers | CAC | Status |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Google Ads | $2000 | 15 | $133 | Keep testing |
| LinkedIn | $2000 | 5 | $400 | Pause |
| Content | $500 | 3 | $167 | Keep testing |

**Focus where CAC < 1/3 of LTV.**

## The Growth Loop

Great GTM strategies create loops, not linear funnels:

### Viral Loop
- User signs up → invites others → they sign up → invite others
- **Example:** Dropbox (get more storage for referrals)
- **Multiplier:** Viral coefficient (K > 1 = exponential growth)

### Content Loop
- Create content → ranks in search → drives signups → users create content → repeat
- **Example:** Stack Overflow, Reddit
- **Multiplier:** User-generated content

### Performance Marketing Loop
- Ad spend → customers → revenue → more ad spend → more customers
- **Example:** E-commerce, SaaS with strong LTV:CAC
- **Multiplier:** LTV:CAC ratio

### Sales Loop
- Customer success → case studies → credibility → easier sales → more customers
- **Example:** Enterprise B2B
- **Multiplier:** Deal size increases over time

**The best loops are self-reinforcing.** Growth creates more growth.

---

## Launch Strategy

### Soft Launch (Beta)
- Limited audience (friends, early adopters, specific community)
- **Goal:** Learn and iterate before wide release
- **Timeline:** 1-3 months
- **Risk:** Momentum fizzles

### Public Launch
- Announce to the world (Product Hunt, Hacker News, press)
- **Goal:** Big splash, fast user acquisition
- **Timeline:** 1 day event, 1 week follow-up
- **Risk:** One shot, must be ready

### Rolling Launch
- Launch to segments sequentially
- **Goal:** Controlled growth, learn and adapt
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months
- **Risk:** Slower, less buzz

**Choose based on readiness and risk tolerance.**

---

## Distribution Advantage (Moats)

The best GTM strategies build defensibility:

### Network Effects
- Product gets better as more people use it
- **Example:** Marketplaces, social platforms
- Makes customer acquisition easier over time

### Brand
- Strong brand reduces CAC (people search for you directly)
- **Example:** Stripe, Notion, Figma
- Built through quality + visibility

### Organic Channels
- Own the search terms that matter
- **Example:** Rank #1 for "[problem] solution"
- Free acquisition at scale

### Integration/Platform
- Embedded in platforms customers already use
- **Example:** Zapier, Slack integrations
- Piggyback on platform distribution

**Build for defensibility, not just initial traction.**

## Red Flags

**"We'll get press coverage and go viral"**
- Viral is not a strategy. It's luck.

**"We'll do everything: ads, content, events, partnerships..."**
- Spreading thin. Pick one channel and win it.

**"Our product is so good, people will just find us"**
- No. Distribution doesn't happen automatically.

**"We'll figure out GTM after we build"**
- Backwards. Distribution is harder than product.

**"Our channel is word-of-mouth"**
- Word-of-mouth is what happens when you have product-market fit and a GTM strategy. It's not the strategy itself.

## The GTM Checklist

Before launch:

- [ ] Have we identified where our target customer hangs out?
- [ ] Have we picked 1-2 channels to focus on?
- [ ] Do we have a realistic CAC target based on LTV?
- [ ] Have we tested channels cheaply before committing budget?
- [ ] Do we have content/messaging ready for our channels?
- [ ] Do we have a way to measure CAC accurately?
- [ ] Have we identified a potential growth loop?
- [ ] Do we have an unfair advantage in distribution?

If you can't check most boxes, your GTM strategy is weak.

---

## Key Insight

**Most products fail because they never find distribution, not because the product was bad.**

Build distribution into your product strategy from day one. A product no one discovers is a product that doesn't exist.
