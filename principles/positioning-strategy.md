## Core Truth

**Positioning is context.** You don't position a product in isolation — you position it against alternatives in the mind of a specific customer. The best product with unclear positioning loses to the mediocre product with clear positioning.

## The Positioning Framework (April Dunford)

Five components that define positioning:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
What would customers use if your product didn't exist?

**Not "competitors" — alternatives:**
- Direct competitors (similar products)
- Indirect solutions (different approach, same job)
- Manual workarounds (spreadsheets, email, paper)
- **Doing nothing** (often the real competition)

**Key question:** "What did you use before this?"

### 2. Unique Attributes
What capabilities do you have that alternatives don't?

**Characteristics of strong attributes:**
- Provable and demonstrable
- Defensible (hard to copy quickly)
- Valued by customers (not just technically interesting)

**Warning:** Features aren't attributes. "Machine learning powered" is not positioning. "10x faster than manual analysis" is.

### 3. Value (What Attributes Enable)
What can customers do with your unique attributes that they couldn't before?

**Translate attributes into value:**
- Attribute: "Real-time sync across devices"
- Value: "Never lose work when switching from phone to laptop"

**Focus on outcomes, not features.**

### 4. Target Customer
Who cares most about this value?

**Not:** "Anyone who needs X"
**Instead:** The segment where your unique value matters most

**Example:**
- Slack is "team communication" for everyone
- Slack positioned as "communication for software teams" initially — narrow wedge, clearest value

### 5. Market Category
What market do you want to be evaluated in?

**Three options:**
- **Existing category** — Join an established market (easier to explain, harder to differentiate)
- **Adjacent category** — Reframe into a category where you win ("Not CRM, revenue intelligence")
- **New category** — Create a new category (hardest to explain, highest potential if you win)

**The test:** When a customer describes you to someone else, what category do they put you in?

## Differentiation Strategies

### 1. Better (feature differentiation)
- Faster, cheaper, easier, more powerful
- **Risk:** Commoditizes over time as competitors catch up
- **Works when:** Performance gap is massive and sustainable

### 2. Different (unique approach)
- Solve the problem in a fundamentally different way
- **Risk:** Requires educating the market
- **Works when:** Existing approaches have inherent limitations

### 3. Focused (specialization)
- Best for a specific segment or use case
- **Risk:** Smaller addressable market
- **Works when:** The segment is underserved and has specific needs

### 4. Integration (ecosystem play)
- Fit seamlessly into an existing workflow or platform
- **Risk:** Dependent on platform
- **Works when:** The platform is entrenched and integration is valuable

**The best differentiation is defensible.** Choose what's hard to copy.

## The Wedge Strategy

Don't try to serve everyone at launch. Start narrow, expand from strength.

### The Wedge
- **Narrow:** Specific segment, specific use case
- **Underserved:** Existing solutions don't fit well
- **Accessible:** You can reach these customers
- **Passionate:** They care deeply about the problem

### Expansion
Once you dominate the wedge:
1. Adjacent segments with similar needs
2. Adjacent use cases for the same segment
3. Broader market (slowly)

**Example:**
- Facebook: Harvard → Ivy League → universities → everyone
- Amazon: Books → electronics → everything

**The mistake:** Trying to be "X for everyone" from day one.

## Messaging Hierarchy

How you talk about your positioning:

### Level 1: Positioning Statement (Internal)
"For [target customer] who [statement of need], [product name] is a [market category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [competitive alternatives], our product [unique differentiator]."

### Level 2: Value Proposition (External)
One sentence that captures what you do and why it matters.
- **Bad:** "AI-powered productivity platform"
- **Good:** "Turn meeting notes into action items automatically, so nothing falls through the cracks"

### Level 3: Messaging Pillars (Content)
3-5 themes that support the value prop:
- Each addresses a key customer pain
- Each highlights a unique capability
- Each is provable with evidence

## Competitive Analysis

Understand the landscape without obsessing over it.

### The 2×2 Matrix
Pick two dimensions that matter to customers:
- Axis 1: A key differentiator (e.g., "ease of use")
- Axis 2: Another differentiator (e.g., "power/flexibility")

Plot yourself and alternatives. Where's the gap?

**The goal:** Find whitespace where customer needs aren't well served.

### Positioning Against "Doing Nothing"

Often the real competition.

**Questions:**
- What's the cost of inaction?
- What triggers people to start looking for a solution?
- What's the switching cost from "doing nothing"?

**Positioning:** Make the cost of inaction feel unbearable.

---

## Red Flags

**"We have no competition"**
- Either the market doesn't exist or you haven't looked
- Customers always have alternatives (including doing nothing)

**"We're better in every way"**
- If you're better at everything, you're not focused
- Meaningful positioning makes trade-offs

**"We're like [big company] but for [different segment]"**
- Lazy positioning
- Doesn't articulate unique value

**"We're the Uber of..."**
- Category analogies rarely work
- Explain what you do, not who you're like

---

## When to Reposition

**Signals you need to reposition:**
- Customers don't understand what you do
- You're losing to alternatives you're better than
- Sales cycles are long because prospects are confused
- You're attracting the wrong customers
- The market has shifted (new competitors, customer needs changed)

**How to reposition:**
1. Talk to customers who chose you (why you?)
2. Talk to customers who chose alternatives (why not you?)
3. Identify the pattern (who values your unique attributes most?)
4. Narrow or shift positioning to that segment
5. Update messaging and GTM

## The Positioning Checklist

- [ ] Can you clearly articulate your competitive alternatives?
- [ ] Can you list 3 unique attributes that alternatives don't have?
- [ ] Can you explain the value those attributes enable (outcomes, not features)?
- [ ] Have you defined a specific target customer who cares most about that value?
- [ ] Can you name the market category you want to be evaluated in?
- [ ] Does your messaging make it obvious why this segment should choose you?
- [ ] Can your target customer repeat your positioning to someone else?

If you can't check all boxes, positioning is unclear.

## Key Insight

**Positioning is the strategy tax you pay to win in the market.** Good positioning makes every other decision easier — what to build, who to sell to, what to say, where to spend. Bad positioning makes great products invisible.

Position deliberately or the market will position you by accident.
