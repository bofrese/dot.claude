# Positioning Strategy Principles

## Core Truth

**Positioning is context.** You position against alternatives in mind of specific customer. Best product with unclear positioning loses to mediocre product with clear positioning.

---

## The Positioning Framework

Five components that define positioning:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

What would customers use if your product didn't exist?

Not "competitors"—alternatives:
- Direct competitors (similar products)
- Indirect solutions (different approach, same job)
- Manual workarounds (spreadsheets, email, paper)
- **Doing nothing** (often real competition)

**Key question:** "What did you use before this?"

### 2. Unique Attributes

What capabilities do you have that alternatives don't?

Strong attributes are:
- Provable and demonstrable
- Defensible (hard to copy quickly)
- Valued by customers (not just technically interesting)

**Warning:** Features ≠ attributes. "ML powered" is not positioning. "10x faster than manual" is.

### 3. Value (What Attributes Enable)

What can customers do with your unique attributes that they couldn't before?

Translate attributes to value:
- Attribute: "Real-time sync across devices"
- Value: "Never lose work when switching phone to laptop"

**Focus on outcomes, not features.**

### 4. Target Customer

Who cares most about this value?

Not: "Anyone who needs X"
Instead: Segment where unique value matters most

Example: Slack = "team communication" for everyone, but positioned as "communication for software teams" initially—narrow wedge, clearest value.

### 5. Market Category

What market do you want evaluated in?

**Three options:**
- **Existing:** Join established market (easier to explain, harder to differentiate)
- **Adjacent:** Reframe ("Not CRM, revenue intelligence")
- **New:** Create category (hardest to explain, highest potential if you win)

**Test:** When customer describes you to others, what category do they use?

## Differentiation Strategies

**Better (feature):** Faster, cheaper, easier, more powerful. Risk: commoditizes. Works: massive sustainable gap.

**Different (approach):** Solve problem fundamentally differently. Risk: market education. Works: existing approaches have inherent limits.

**Focused (specialization):** Best for specific segment/use case. Risk: smaller market. Works: segment underserved with specific needs.

**Integration (ecosystem):** Fit seamlessly into existing workflow/platform. Risk: platform dependency. Works: platform entrenched, integration valuable.

**Best differentiation is defensible.** Choose what's hard to copy.

---

## The Wedge Strategy

Start narrow, expand from strength.

**The Wedge:**
- Narrow: Specific segment, specific use case
- Underserved: Existing solutions don't fit
- Accessible: You can reach them
- Passionate: Care deeply about problem

**Expansion:** Once wedge dominated:
1. Adjacent segments, similar needs
2. Adjacent use cases, same segment
3. Broader market (slowly)

**Example:** Facebook (Harvard → Ivy → universities → everyone), Amazon (books → electronics → everything)

**Mistake:** "X for everyone" from day one.

---

## Messaging Hierarchy

**Level 1 (Internal):** "For [target] who [need], [product] is [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], [differentiator]."

**Level 2 (External):** One sentence: what you do + why it matters.
- Bad: "AI-powered productivity platform"
- Good: "Turn meeting notes into action items automatically, so nothing falls through cracks"

**Level 3 (Content):** 3-5 messaging pillars. Each addresses pain, highlights capability, provable with evidence.

## Competitive Analysis

### 2×2 Matrix

Pick two dimensions that matter to customers (e.g., "ease of use" vs "power/flexibility").
Plot yourself and alternatives.
Find whitespace where needs aren't well served.

### Positioning Against "Doing Nothing"

Often real competition.

Questions:
- Cost of inaction?
- What triggers search for solution?
- Switching cost from doing nothing?

**Positioning:** Make inaction cost feel unbearable.

---

## Red Flags

**"No competition"** → Either market doesn't exist or you haven't looked. Customers always have alternatives.

**"Better in every way"** → Not focused. Meaningful positioning makes trade-offs.

**"Like [big company] but for [segment]"** → Lazy. Doesn't articulate unique value.

**"The Uber of..."** → Category analogies rarely work. Explain what you do, not who you're like.

---

## When to Reposition

**Signals:**
- Customers don't understand what you do
- Losing to alternatives you're better than
- Long sales cycles from confusion
- Attracting wrong customers
- Market shifted (new competitors, changed needs)

**How:**
1. Talk to customers who chose you (why?)
2. Talk to those who chose alternatives (why not?)
3. Identify pattern (who values your attributes most?)
4. Narrow or shift to that segment
5. Update messaging and GTM

## Checklist

- [ ] Clearly articulate competitive alternatives?
- [ ] List 3 unique attributes alternatives lack?
- [ ] Explain value those attributes enable (outcomes, not features)?
- [ ] Defined specific target who cares most?
- [ ] Named market category for evaluation?
- [ ] Messaging makes obvious why segment should choose you?
- [ ] Target can repeat positioning to others?

## Key Insight

**Positioning = strategy tax to win market.** Good positioning makes everything easier—what to build, who to sell to, what to say, where to spend. Bad positioning makes great products invisible.

Position deliberately or market positions you by accident.
