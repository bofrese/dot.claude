# Business Model Principles

Compact reference for business model thinking, value proposition, and unit economics. Load when working on monetization, pricing, or business strategy.

## Core Truth

**Value creation before value capture.** First, create immense value for customers. Then, capture a fair portion. Get order wrong = no business model saves you.

---

## The Value Equation

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort)**

Maximize numerator, minimize denominator.

- **Dream Outcome:** Specific result customer wants. "Save 2h/week" > "be productive"
- **Perceived Likelihood:** Why they'll believe it works. Proof: testimonials, guarantees, case studies
- **Time Delay:** How fast they get results. Immediate wins build trust
- **Effort & Sacrifice:** How easy to use/adopt. Lower friction = higher value

## Revenue Model Patterns

| Model | Best When | Metrics | Pros/Cons |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Subscription** | Ongoing value, high retention | MRR/ARR, churn, LTV | Predictable revenue / Churn kills |
| **Transaction** | Value tied to transactions | Volume, take rate, GMV | Aligns with success / Revenue volatility |
| **Freemium** | Low marginal cost, viral | Free→paid conversion | Fast acquisition / Most never pay |
| **Usage-Based** | Value scales with usage | Units consumed, $/unit | Flexible, aligns value / Unpredictable |
| **One-Time** | Fixed value, no ongoing service | CAC, conversion | Upfront cash / Must keep acquiring |
| **Marketplace** | Connect buyers/sellers | Take rate, GMV, liquidity | Network effects / Chicken-egg problem |
| **Hybrid** | Strategic combination | Combined | Best of both / More complex |

Choose model that aligns with value delivery.

## Unit Economics

Math must work at individual customer level.

### Critical Metrics

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**
- Marketing + sales spend ÷ new customers
- Include: ads, salaries, tools

**LTV (Lifetime Value)**
- ARPU × gross margin ÷ churn rate
- Or: avg revenue per customer × gross margin × lifespan

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
- Target: > 3:1
- Minimum: > 1:1
- Ideal: 4:1 to 5:1

**Payback Period**
- Time to recover CAC
- Target: < 12 months
- Ideal: < 6 months

**Gross Margin**
- Revenue - COGS
- SaaS: > 70%
- Marketplace: > 40%
- Physical: > 30%

**Brutal truth: LTV:CAC < 3:1 = no business, just expensive hobby.**

---

## Pricing Strategy

Pricing = positioning. Signals value and selects customers.

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchor high:** First number = reference point. Show expensive option first.

**Good/Better/Best:** 3 tiers. Most choose middle. Top makes middle feel reasonable.

**Value-based:** Price on value delivered, not cost incurred. "What's worth to them?" not "What costs us?"

**Decoy effect:** Slightly worse option at similar price makes better option look like steal.

### Common Mistakes

- **Too low:** Signals low value, attracts churners, breaks unit economics
- **"Competitive":** Assumes you're same as competitors (you're not), race to bottom
- **Cost-plus:** Ignores value perception, leaves money on table

**The test:** "Would I pay this for this value?" If you hesitate, value unclear or price wrong.

## Business Model Canvas (Compact)

**Value Proposition:** What value for whom? Why them?

**Customer Segments:** Distinct groups served

**Revenue Streams:** How money flows (subscription, transaction, etc.)

**Cost Structure:** Fixed and variable costs

**Key Activities:** What must you do to deliver value?

**Key Resources:** Essential assets (team, IP, infrastructure)

**Channels:** How customers discover and buy

**Customer Relationships:** Acquire, retain, grow

**Key Partnerships:** Who helps deliver value?

## Validation Questions

- [ ] LTV:CAC > 3:1?
- [ ] Payback < 12 months?
- [ ] Gross margin > 40%?
- [ ] Customers get value before we capture revenue?
- [ ] Revenue grows as customer success grows?
- [ ] Defensible moat (network effects, IP, brand, switching costs)?
- [ ] Can sustain margins if competitors enter?
- [ ] Have resources to support this model?
- [ ] Understand customer acquisition motion?

## Red Flags

**"Monetization later"** → No. Business model = core strategy, not afterthought.

**"Make it up on volume"** → If unit economics broken, volume makes problem bigger.

**"Everyone will pay"** → Most won't. Design for who actually pays.

**"Just reduce churn"** → If LTV fundamentally low, churn isn't problem—product is.

---

## Key Insight

**Best business models create virtuous cycle:** Customer success → revenue → reinvestment → more success.

If model doesn't align incentives (you win when customers win), it's fragile.
