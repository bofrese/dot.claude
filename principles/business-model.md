## Core Truth

**Value creation before value capture.** First, create immense value for customers. Then, capture a fair portion of it. Get this order wrong and no business model will save you.

---

## The Value Equation (Alex Hormozi)

How customers perceive value:

```
           (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
Value = ──────────────────────────────────────────
         (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Maximize the numerator, minimize the denominator.**

### Dream Outcome
What result does the customer desperately want?
- Be specific: "Save 2 hours per week" beats "be more productive"
- Make it measurable and tangible

### Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Why will they believe this actually works?
- Proof: testimonials, case studies, guarantees
- Reduce skepticism before they buy

### Time Delay
How fast do they get results?
- Immediate wins build trust
- Long-term value sustains retention
- Compress time to value wherever possible

### Effort & Sacrifice
How easy is it to use and adopt?
- Lower friction = higher perceived value
- What do they have to give up or change?
- Automate, simplify, eliminate steps

## Revenue Model Patterns

Choose the model that aligns with value delivery:

### Subscription (SaaS)
- **Best when:** Ongoing value, retention is high, predictable usage
- **Metrics:** MRR/ARR, churn, LTV
- **Pros:** Predictable revenue, compounds over time
- **Cons:** Churn kills you, slow initial growth

### Transaction-Based
- **Best when:** Value is tied to transactions or events
- **Metrics:** Transaction volume, take rate, GMV
- **Pros:** Aligns revenue with customer success
- **Cons:** Revenue volatility

### Freemium
- **Best when:** Low marginal cost, viral growth, conversion funnel is proven
- **Metrics:** Free-to-paid conversion, upgrade rate
- **Pros:** Fast user acquisition
- **Cons:** Most users never pay, support costs

### Usage-Based
- **Best when:** Value scales with usage, customers want flexibility
- **Metrics:** Units consumed, revenue per unit
- **Pros:** Aligns with customer value
- **Cons:** Revenue unpredictability

### One-Time Purchase
- **Best when:** Fixed value delivery, no ongoing service
- **Metrics:** CAC, conversion rate
- **Pros:** Upfront cash
- **Cons:** No recurring revenue, must keep acquiring

### Marketplace
- **Best when:** You connect buyers and sellers
- **Metrics:** Take rate, GMV, liquidity
- **Pros:** Network effects
- **Cons:** Chicken-and-egg problem

### Hybrid
Combine models strategically (e.g., subscription + usage overages)

## Unit Economics

The math must work at the individual customer level:

### Critical Metrics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
- Total marketing + sales spend ÷ new customers acquired
- Includes all costs to acquire: ads, sales salaries, tools

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)**
- Average revenue per customer × gross margin × average customer lifespan
- Or: ARPU × gross margin ÷ churn rate

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
- **Target:** > 3:1 (make $3 for every $1 spent acquiring)
- **Minimum:** > 1:1 (don't lose money on each customer)
- **Ideal:** 4:1 to 5:1 (healthy, scalable)

**Payback Period**
- How long to recover CAC from customer revenue
- **Target:** < 12 months
- **Ideal:** < 6 months

**Gross Margin**
- Revenue minus direct costs (COGS)
- **SaaS target:** > 70%
- **Marketplace target:** > 40%
- **Physical goods:** > 30%

### The Brutal Truth

If LTV:CAC < 3:1, you don't have a business. You have a hobby that burns money.

## Pricing Strategy

Pricing is positioning. It signals value and selects customers.

### Pricing Psychology

**Anchor high**
- First number seen becomes the reference point
- Show the most expensive option first
- Discounts feel valuable against a high anchor

**Good / Better / Best (3-tier model)**
- Most people choose the middle
- Top tier makes middle feel reasonable
- Bottom tier exists to make middle feel premium

**Value-based pricing**
- Price on value delivered, not cost incurred
- Ask: "What's this worth to them?" not "What does it cost us?"
- Capture a fraction of the value you create

**Decoy effect**
- A slightly worse option at a similar price makes the better option look like a steal
- Example: $99/mo for 10 users vs. $119/mo for unlimited users

### Common Mistakes

**Pricing too low**
- Signals low value
- Attracts price-sensitive customers who churn
- Makes it impossible to hit good unit economics

**Pricing "competitively"**
- Assumes you're the same as competitors (you're not)
- Race to the bottom

**Cost-plus pricing**
- Ignores customer value perception
- Leaves money on the table

### The Test

"Would I pay this price for this value?"
If you hesitate, either the value isn't clear or the price is wrong.

## Business Model Canvas (Lean)

Map the core components:

### Value Proposition
What value do you create? For whom? Why them?

### Customer Segments
Who are the distinct groups you serve?

### Revenue Streams
How does money flow to you? (subscription, transaction, etc.)

### Cost Structure
What are the fixed and variable costs?

### Key Activities
What must you do to deliver value?

### Key Resources
What assets (team, IP, infrastructure) are essential?

### Channels
How do customers discover and buy?

### Customer Relationships
How do you acquire, retain, and grow customers?

### Key Partnerships
Who helps you deliver value? (suppliers, platforms, etc.)

## Validation Questions

Before locking in a business model:

**Does the economics work?**
- [ ] LTV:CAC > 3:1?
- [ ] Payback period < 12 months?
- [ ] Gross margin > 40%?

**Does the model align with value?**
- [ ] Do customers get value before we capture revenue?
- [ ] Does our revenue grow as customer success grows?

**Is this defensible?**
- [ ] Is there a moat (network effects, IP, brand, switching costs)?
- [ ] Can we sustain margins if competitors enter?

**Can we execute this?**
- [ ] Do we have the resources to support this model?
- [ ] Do we understand the customer acquisition motion?

## Red Flags

**"We'll figure out monetization later"** — No. Business model is core strategy, not an afterthought.

**"We'll make it up on volume"** — If unit economics don't work, volume makes the problem bigger.

**"Everyone will want to pay for this"** — Most won't. Design for who actually pays.

**"Just need to reduce churn"** — If LTV is fundamentally too low, churn isn't the problem — the product is.

---

## Key Insight

**The best business models create a virtuous cycle:** Customer success → your revenue → reinvestment in product → more customer success.

If the model doesn't align incentives (you win when customers win), it's fragile.
