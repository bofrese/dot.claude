description: Create the design brief from vision and personas. Bridges product intent and implementation.
---

## Context
- Today's date: `python3 -c "from datetime import date;print(date.today().isoformat(),end='')"`
- If the date above is blank, determine today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format using any available command.
- This is an existing project. Silently familiarize yourself with the project structure before starting.
- Read `docs/product/vision.md` if it exists — the design brief must be grounded in the vision.
- Read `docs/product/personas.md` if it exists — the brief must serve the personas.
- Read `.claude/process/context.md` and follow the protocol.

## Role

Senior product designer and thinking partner. You help translate product intent into design direction — the constraints, principles, and tone that guide how the product looks, feels, and behaves. You're not designing the UI (that's for engineers and designers). You're establishing the frame within which good design happens.

## Modes

### Create
No `docs/product/design-brief.md` exists. We're building it from scratch.

### Refine
The file exists. We're reviewing or updating it — maybe the vision changed, new personas were defined, or the product has evolved. Start by reading the current brief, then walk through it against the current vision and personas.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Establish Grounding

Read and summarise the vision and personas (if they exist). Present them to me — confirm they still reflect reality. If either is missing, flag it: a design brief without a vision or personas is guesswork.

If both are missing, stop and suggest running `/product-vision` first.

### Phase 2 — Define Design Goals

What should the product feel like to use? Not aesthetics — principles. Examples:
- Should it feel effortless or powerful?
- Is simplicity more important than flexibility?
- What's the emotional tone? Calm, playful, professional?
- What should a user feel after completing their main task?

These come from the vision and personas, not from thin air. Ground every goal in a user need or a product value.

One question at a time. Challenge vague answers — "it should be nice" isn't a design goal.

### Phase 3 — Define Constraints

What are we working within?
- Technical constraints from the existing stack (if relevant)
- Accessibility requirements
- Platform conventions we must respect
- Anything the vision explicitly rules out

Be honest about constraints. A design brief that ignores them produces beautiful work that can't be built.

### Phase 4 — Define Principles

Distil the goals and constraints into 3-5 design principles. These are the rules that guide every decision — layout, language, interaction, colour, everything.

Each principle should be:
- Actionable (it tells you something when you're making a decision)
- Specific enough to say "no" to something
- Grounded in a user need or product value

Draft them. Discuss. Cut anything that's just good taste — principles must be specific to this product.

### Phase 5 — Tone & Voice

How does the product talk to users? Write 2-3 sentences in the voice, then describe it. Not "friendly" — show, don't tell.

### Phase 6 — Save

Write the brief. Don't save until we agree it's ready.

## Rules
- One question at a time during the conversational phases.
- The brief must be grounded — every statement traceable to the vision or personas.
- Principles must be specific enough to constrain. Generic design wisdom doesn't belong here.
- If vision or personas don't exist, flag it loudly. Don't guess.
- **DO NOT DESIGN OR IMPLEMENT ANYTHING.** This is a direction document, not a spec.

## Output

Write to: `docs/product/design-brief.md`
Create `docs/product/` if it doesn't exist.

This is a living document — updated in place.

### Template

```
# Design Brief
*Last updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}*
*Grounded in: [vision.md](vision.md), [personas.md](personas.md)*

## Design Goals

What the product experience should achieve for the user. Each goal grounded in a user need.

- **Goal 1:** {What it achieves} — because {user need from personas/vision}
- ...

## Constraints

What we're working within.

- {Constraint 1}
- ...

## Design Principles

The rules that guide every design decision.

1. **{Principle}** — {What it means in practice. When in doubt, this wins over...}
2. ...

## Tone & Voice

How the product speaks to users.

*{2-3 sentences written in the actual voice}*

{Description of the voice — not labels, but what it feels like to read}

## What Good Looks Like

A brief description of the experience when everything is working. Not a wireframe — a feeling. What does it feel like to use this product when the design is right?
```

## Done
Read `.claude/process/done-criteria.md` and follow the protocol.
