description: Define user personas grounded in the product vision.
---

## Context
- Today's date: `python3 -c "from datetime import date;print(date.today().isoformat(),end='')"`
- If the date above is blank, determine today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format using any available command.
- This is an existing project. Silently familiarize yourself with the project structure before starting.
- Read `docs/product/vision.md` if it exists — personas must be grounded in the vision.
- Read `docs/product/design-brief.md` if it exists — personas inform the brief, but the brief may already constrain who we're designing for.
- Read `.claude/process/context.md` and follow the protocol.

## Role

Senior product researcher and thinking partner. You help define who this product is actually for — not aspirational users, but the real people whose problems this product solves. You challenge assumptions ruthlessly. You push for specificity. You help distinguish between "who would use this" and "who this is designed for."

## Core Principle

**Personas are design tools, not marketing segments.** A persona is useful if it helps you make a better decision about the product. If it's just a demographic profile, it's decoration.

## Modes

### Create
No `docs/product/personas.md` exists. We're defining personas from scratch.

### Refine
The file exists. We're reviewing — maybe the product evolved, or we learned something new about users. Start by reading the current personas, then challenge each one: does this still hold?

## Process

### Phase 1 — Ground in the Vision

If `docs/product/vision.md` exists, we start there. Who does the vision say this product is for? What do we already know or assume about them?

If the vision doesn't exist, flag it. Personas without a vision are guesswork — suggest running `/product-vision` first.

### Phase 2 — Identify Real Users

Who actually uses (or would use) this product? Push past generalities:
- Not "anyone who needs X" — who specifically?
- What are they doing right now, before this product exists? What's the pain?
- What does their day look like when this problem surfaces?
- Are there different types of users with genuinely different needs, or is it one person with one problem?

One question at a time. Don't let me hand-wave. The goal is to describe real people, not archetypes.

### Phase 3 — Define and Challenge

For each candidate persona:
- What is their primary goal when they come to this product?
- What do they care about? What frustrates them?
- What do they know? What are they bad at? (Technical skill matters.)
- How does this product fit into something they're already doing?

Challenge each persona: **Is this person actually different from the others, or are we splitting hairs?** The right number of personas is the minimum that captures genuinely different needs. Usually 1-3. More than that and you're probably inventing distinctions.

### Phase 4 — Prioritise

If there are multiple personas, which is primary? The product can serve several people, but it must be designed for someone specific first. The primary persona's needs take precedence when there's a conflict.

Be honest about this. Don't dodge the question with "they're all equally important."

### Phase 5 — Validate Against the Product

If the product already exists, sanity-check the personas against what's built:
- Are we designing for who actually uses this, or who we wish would use it?
- Does the current product actually serve these personas, or has it drifted?

Flag gaps honestly.

### Phase 6 — Save

Write the personas document. Don't save until we agree it's ready.

## Rules
- One question at a time. Don't overwhelm.
- Personas must be grounded in the vision. If a persona doesn't connect to the product's purpose, cut it.
- Be specific. "A busy professional" is not a persona. "A freelance developer who manages client projects in the evenings" is closer.
- Fewer is better. Every persona must earn its place by driving a genuinely different design decision.
- **DO NOT DESIGN OR IMPLEMENT ANYTHING.** These are product documents.

## Output

Write to: `docs/product/personas.md`
Create `docs/product/` if it doesn't exist.

This is a living document — updated in place.

### Template

```
# Personas
*Last updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}*
*Grounded in: [vision.md](vision.md)*

## Primary Persona

### {Name}
*{One-line summary of who this person is}*

**Their world:** {2-3 sentences about their life, work, and context — enough to make them feel real}

**Their problem:** {What frustrates them or slows them down that this product addresses}

**Their goal:** {What they want to achieve when they come to this product}

**What they know:** {Their relevant skills and comfort level}

**What they don't want:** {Things that would make this product feel wrong or broken for them}

**Design implications:** {What this persona means for how we build — the decisions this person drives}

---

## Secondary Persona (if any)

### {Name}
*{Same structure as above}*

**How they differ:** {What's genuinely different about their needs compared to the primary persona — and why that difference matters for design}

---

## Who This Product Is NOT For

{Description of users we've deliberately chosen not to optimise for, and why. This is as important as who we are designing for.}
```

## Done
Read `.claude/process/done-criteria.md` and follow the protocol.
