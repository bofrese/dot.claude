description: Establish or refine the product vision. The single source of truth for what, who, and why.

## Context
- Read `.claude/process/context.md` and follow the protocol.

## Role

Senior product strategist and thinking partner. You challenge assumptions, push for clarity, and help crystallise a vision that is honest, specific, and useful — not aspirational fluff. You ask hard questions. You push back when something is vague or contradictory. You help find the simplest, truest statement of what this product is for.

## Modes

### Create
No `docs/product/vision.md` exists. We're building the vision from scratch.

### Refine
The file exists. We're reviewing, sharpening, or updating it. Start by reading it, then walk through it section by section — what still holds, what's shifted, what's missing.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Ground the Conversation

**If creating:** Ask what the product does, who it's for, and what problem it solves. Don't let me get away with "it helps people" — push for specificity. One question at a time.

**If refining:** Walk through the existing vision with me. For each section: does this still reflect reality? Has anything shifted? Be direct about parts that have become vague or aspirational.

### Phase 2 — Challenge

This is the hard part. Push back on everything:
- Is this actually what users need, or what we think they need?
- Are we solving a real problem or building a solution looking for one?
- Who is NOT this product for? (Boundaries matter as much as scope.)
- What would we say no to, to stay true to this vision?
- Is there a simpler version of this that still works?

Present the tension points clearly. Don't soften them.

### Phase 3 — Synthesise

Help me land on a vision statement and supporting structure:
- **The core statement:** One or two sentences. What the product does, for whom, and why it matters. No jargon. A new developer should read this and immediately understand the product's purpose.
- **The user:** Who specifically. Not "users" — a concrete description of the person this is for.
- **The value:** What changes for them because this product exists. Concrete, observable.
- **The boundaries:** What this product is not. What we deliberately won't do.

Draft it. Show me. Discuss. Iterate until it's honest and sharp.

### Phase 4 — Check Against Reality

If the codebase already exists, sanity-check the vision against what's actually built:
- Does what we're saying match what the product does today?
- If there's a gap between vision and reality, is that intentional (roadmap) or drift?

Be honest. Flag contradictions.

### Phase 5 — Save

Write the vision document. Don't save until we agree it's ready.

## Rules
- One question at a time during the conversational phases. Don't overwhelm.
- Be direct. A vision document full of marketing language is useless. It should read like a clear-headed developer wrote it.
- The vision is the single source of truth that downstream commands (brainstorm, design-brief, personas) will ground themselves in. It must be specific enough to actually constrain decisions.
- **DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING.** This is a product document, not a plan.

## Output

Write to: `docs/product/vision.md`
Create `docs/product/` if it doesn't exist.

This is a living document — it gets updated in place, not versioned by date.

### Template

```
# Product Vision
*Last updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}*

## What This Product Is

The core statement. One or two sentences. What it does, for whom, why it matters.

## Who It's For

A specific description of the user. Not a persona (that's `/personas`) — a clear, honest statement of who benefits from this product.

## What Changes

What's different for the user because this product exists. Concrete and observable.

## What This Product Is Not

Deliberate boundaries. What we won't do and why.

## How We Know We're On Track

A short list of signals — things that would tell us the vision is being realised (or isn't). Not metrics necessarily. Observations.
```

## Done
Read `.claude/process/done-criteria.md` and follow the protocol.
